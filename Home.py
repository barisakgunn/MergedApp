    # Simulation of Spin-Glass phases in the 3D Ising model

    ðŸ“– **Overview**

    This project implements a spin glass simulation using the Ising model.  
    The Ising model is a fundamental tool in statistical mechanics used to study phase transitions, magnetism, and disordered systems such as spin glasses.

    The project uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate spin interactions and analyze the systemâ€™s behavior under varying temperature values.

    âš¡ **Features** 
    - Ferromagnetic and spin glass couplings (positive/negative interactions)  
    - Monte Carlo updates  
    - Temperature-dependent simulations  
    - 3D Visualization of lattice evolution and thermodynamic quantities
