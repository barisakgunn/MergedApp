    # Spin Glass Simulation (Ising Model in MATLAB)

    ðŸ“– **Overview**

    This project implements a spin glass simulation using the Ising model in MATLAB.  
    The Ising model is a fundamental tool in statistical mechanics used to study phase transitions, magnetism, and disordered systems such as spin glasses.

    The project uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate spin interactions and analyze the systemâ€™s behavior under varying temperature and coupling conditions.

    âš¡ **Features**
    - 2D/3D lattice initialization with random spin configurations  
    - Ferromagnetic and spin glass couplings (positive/negative interactions)  
    - Monte Carlo updates  
    - Temperature-dependent simulations  
    - Visualization of lattice evolution and thermodynamic quantities
